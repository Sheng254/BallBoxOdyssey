Experience the comical adventure of BallBox Odyssey, a game where you take command of a ball inside a box. Harness your finger tapping prowess to guide the ball, utilising the mighty arrow keys as your ultimate weapon!

## Project Description
- An exceedingly basic game developed by myself to gain insights into building a simple web app using frontend languages.It serves as a learning project that showcases the implementation of fundamental concepts in web development.
- Developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Consists of three different files:
  - index.html (Defines the structure and layout of the game)
  - styles.css (Contains the CSS styles responsible for the visual appearance of the game elements.)
  - script.js (Implements the game logic and controls user interactions.)
- Deployed on the GitHub Pages platform for easy access.

## How to Play
Navigate the ball within the box by using the arrow keys for movement.
