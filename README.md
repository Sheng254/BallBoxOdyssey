Experience the comical adventure of BallBox Odyssey, a game where you take command of a ball inside a box. Harness your finger tapping prowess to guide the ball, utilising the mighty arrow keys as your ultimate weapon!

## Project Description
- An exceedingly basic game developed by myself to gain insights into building a simple web app using frontend languages. It serves as a learning project that showcases the implementation of fundamental concepts in web development.
- Developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Consists of three different files:
  - index.html (Defines the structure and layout of the game)
  - styles.css (Contains the CSS styles responsible for the visual appearance of the game elements.)
  - script.js (Implements the game logic and controls user interactions.)
- Deployed on the GitHub Pages platform for easy access.

## How to Play
Navigate the ball within the box by using the arrow keys for movement. Note that this game is not playable on mobile devices.

##  Potential Enhancements for the Future
- **Adding black boxes representing mines and a food item as rewards.** The objective of the player would be to collect the food while avoiding the mines. 
- **Implementing a life system.** Adding a life system would bring an extra layer of challenge and consequence to the game. The player could start with a certain number of lives, such as three, and each time they touch a mine, they would lose one life. If all lives are depleted, the game would end. 
- **Introducing a level progression system.** Each level could introduce additional mines or increase the speed of the ball, challenging the player to improve their skills as they advance. 
- **Enhancing visual elements.** Adding animations effects for actions like collecting food or colliding with mines would make the game more engaging and entertaining.
- **Adapting the game for mobile devices.** Implementing touch controls or creating a mobile-friendly version would allow players to enjoy the game on their smartphones or tablets.
